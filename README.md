Play-CMS is a project which has the target to deliver a simple, reactive and fast CMS alternative to the common CMS.
PHP as programming Language is quite slow, painful in use. So it is time to start a new Project.
It is mission to develop a CMS which contains the minimal and necessary components for a CMS. After we had done this,
the way is free to envelope the CMS to a more powerful CMS.

Play and Scala are one of the best solutions for this target. But Play also has problems. So it is not possible to
change HTML-Templates in running service. It is necessary to compile it and to upload it. This problem has to be solved.

At the moment we start with building a minimal CMS.

You can use this CMS for your projects. It is not allowed to remove any hyperlink of the Developer (http://intelligyscience.de)
